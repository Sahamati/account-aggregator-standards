Welcome here! 
Before submitting pull requests, please make sure that you have **read the whole guidelines**. If you have any doubts about this contribution guide, please open [an issue](https://github.com/Sahamati/account-aggregator-standards/issues/new/choose).

## Contributing

### Contributor

Being a contributor, we request you to follow the points mentioned below:

- No duplication allowed. This work will not be merged.
- Please follow the repository guidelines and standards mentioned below.

### Making Changes

#### Documentation

- If you have modified/added documentation, please ensure that your language is concise and must not contain grammatical errors.
- Do not update [`README.md`](https://github.com/Sahamati/account-aggregator-standards/blob/main/readme.md) along with other changes. First, create an issue and then link to that issue in your pull request to suggest specific changes required to [`README.md`](https://github.com/Sahamati/account-aggregator-standards/blob/main/readme.md).

#### Commit Guidelines

- Try to modify just required file at once. Pull requests that span multiple directories are often rejected.
- Firstly, set up your own fork of the repository

When fixing an issue - 
```bash
git checkout -b <issue number>
git add filename
git commit -m "your message"
```
Now, after pushing the changes, create a pull request to the main branch of the repository.

Well done, you are now a contributor!
